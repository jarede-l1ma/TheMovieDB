- **Responsive Layout:** Adapts to device orientation (portrait/landscape) and screen sizes.
- **Localization:** Supports English and Brazilian Portuguese (auto-detects device language).
- **Asynchronous Networking:** Modern async/await API usage.
- **Image Caching:** Fast poster loading with local cache for smooth scrolling.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to build and run the app locally:

### 1. Clone the repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/themoviedb-ios-app.git
cd themoviedb-ios-app

```

### 2. Open in Xcode:
   ‚Ä¢ Open the file TheMovieDB.xcodeproj using Xcode 15 or newer.

### 3. Setup TMDb API Token:
   ‚Ä¢ This app requires a TMDb API Bearer Token.
   ‚Ä¢ In APIClient.swift, replace the value of bearerToken with your own (find it on your TMDb dashboard):
   
        private let bearerToken = "YOUR-BEARER-TOKEN-HERE"
   ‚Ä¢ Important: Do not share your token publicly.

### üèõÔ∏è Architectural Overview & Decisions

‚Ä¢ Architecture:
The app is structured using VIP-C:
View ‚Äì Interactor ‚Äì Presenter ‚Äì Coordinator, with ViewModels for UI adaptation.

‚Ä¢ Layer descriptions:
   ‚Ä¢ View:
  Responsible for displaying UI and user interactions.  

  Receives data from the ViewModel and outputs user actions to the Interactor.

- **Interactor:**  

  Handles business logic, data fetching, and processing.  

  Calls API clients, manages pagination, and passes results to the Presenter.

- **Presenter:**  

  Prepares and formats raw data for display.  

  Converts models into `ViewModel` objects suitable for the UI, ensuring presentation separation.

- **ViewModel:**  

  Lightweight data structures tailored for each view, containing only what's needed for display (titles, subtitles, images, etc.).

- **Coordinator:**  

  Manages navigation and flow between screens, decoupling routing logic from UI code.

- **Localization:**  

  The interface and API requests adapt automatically to the device‚Äôs language (English or Brazilian Portuguese), with fallback to English.


‚Ä¢ UI:
   ‚Ä¢ UIKit with programmatic layout.
   ‚Ä¢ Uses UICollectionViewCompositionalLayout for responsive, adaptive grids.
   ‚Ä¢ Image loading and caching are managed asynchronously for smooth scrolling.

### üß∞ Libraries & Tools Used

‚Ä¢ UIKit:
For building the user interface, as it‚Äôs flexible and provides fine-grained control over layout and navigation.
‚Ä¢ Swift Concurrency (async/await):
Provides modern, readable, and safe asynchronous networking and image loading.
‚Ä¢ UICollectionViewCompositionalLayout:
Enables adaptive and highly customizable collection view layouts without third-party dependencies.
‚Ä¢ Localization (Foundation):
Native support for English and Brazilian Portuguese, including dynamic request localization for the API.
‚Ä¢ NSCache:
For efficient in-memory image caching, reducing redundant network requests.
‚Ä¢ No third-party dependencies:
The app is built using only Apple‚Äôs frameworks for security, performance, and longevity.
